# reservation-service
This repository provides a sample microservice implementation based on the reservation data model from the O'Reilly book [Cassandra: The Definitive Guide, 3rd Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Cassandra-Definitive-Guide-Distributed-Scale/dp/1098115163)

![Book Cover](images/cassandra-tdg.jpg)

See especially Chapter 7: "Designing Applications with Cassandra", which describes the design of the service, and Chapter 8: "Application Development with Drivers", which covers the implementation.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a minimally functional implementation of a microservice that uses Apache Cassandra for its data storage via the DataStax Java Driver. The Reservation Service is implemented as a RESTful service using Spring Boot and exposes it's API via Swagger.

This service leverages the [reservation schema][schema] developed in the book, based on the data model shown here:

If you'd like to understand more about the motivation behind this design, you can access the data modeling chapter from the book for free at the [O'Reilly website][chapter].

## Requirements

This service runs on Java 11 or [12](https://jdk.java.net/12/) and uses the [DataStax Java Driver][driver].

## <a name="runservice">Running the Reservation Service</a>

The Reservation Service requires a Cassandra cluster consisting of least one node. 

Here are some different options for running the Reservation Service: 

- Option 1: Run Cassandra and the Reservation Service in Docker with `docker-compose` command.
    - Build the application by running `./mvnw compile`
    - `docker-compose up` if you want to follow the logs **OR**
    - `docker-compose up -d` to start all containers in detached mode.
    
- Option 2: Running using Spring boot against a local Cassandra instance
    - Confirm the default JDK is version 11 or later
    - Download binaries for your platform from http://cassandra.apache.org/download/
    - Unzip the archive, for example `tar xvf apache-cassandra-3.11.6-bin.tar.gz some-directory`
    - Start Cassandra by running `bin/cassandra`
    - Start spring-boot app by running `./mvnw spring-boot:run` 

## Swagger API
Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger API at `localhost:8080`.

## Running Tests
The test suite for the Reservation Service uses the [Test Containers][testcontainers] project to start a Cassandra node in Docker. You'll want to shut down any infrastructure you created above under [Running the Reservation Service](#runservice). 

Run the test suite with the Maven `test` target:

`./mvnw test`

## Exercises
This repository is configured with branches that represent the start point and solution for various exercises used in an online course taught periodically with [O'Reilly Live Training][live-training]. These exercises remove some of the application code and require you to add it back in to get the service back to a functional state. There are exercises to help you learn the various ways of executing statements, such as `SimpleStatement`, `PreparedStatement`, `QueryBuilder` and the Object Mapper. Other exercises teach you how to use batches, lightweight transactions and materialized views.

To work on an exercise, select the branch that represents the start point of the exercise, for example: `git checkout simple-statement`. Then search through the code and complete the `TODO` items and run the service again until the service is working. You can view the solution code for a given exercise in the `_solution` branch, for example `git checkout simple-statement-solution`.

This repository was updated beginning in July 2019 to use the DataStax Java Driver Version 4.x series. Branches beginning with `old_` represent exercises from a prior version of the course and use the 2.x Driver.

## Disclaimers
This service has a couple of shortcomings that would be inappropriate for a production-ready service implementation:

- There is minimal data validation
- There is minimal handling of fault cases
- The schema makes use of Strings as identifiers instead of UUIDs

With respect to that last point about UUIDs: for this service I take the same approach that I did for the book. When working with small scale examples, it is simpler to deal with IDs that are human readable strings. If I were intending to build a real system out of this or even implement more of the "ecosystem" of services implied by the book's data model, I would move toward using UUIDs for identifiers. For more of my thinking on this topic, please read the [Identity blog post][identity] from my [Data Model Meets World][dmmw] series.

I found [this tutorial][tutorial] helpful in getting this implementation up and running quickly.
