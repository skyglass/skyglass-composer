These examples are not intended to represent a complete application, but are more of the bare minimum code required to 
access various Cassandra features . As such, the examples are useful for cut and paste into your applications according 
to the Apache license below. See the [Reservation Service](https://github.com/jeffreyscarpenter/reservation-service)
repository for a more well rounded example.
