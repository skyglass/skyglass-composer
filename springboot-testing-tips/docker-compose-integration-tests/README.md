This is the source code for this tutorial: https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/03/writing-integration-tests-docker-compose-junit/

Before running the tests, please, make sure tha that the following environment variables are set in your operation system:
DOCKER_COMPOSE_LOCATION=C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\docker-compose.exe

DOCKER_LOCATION=C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\docker.exe

In case there are any troubles, make sure you restart your IDE, so these variables could apply.
